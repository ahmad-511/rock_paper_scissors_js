I suggest completing Dave Gray's [8 hour JavaScript course tutorial video](https://youtu.be/EfAl9bwzVZk) if you are new to Javascript.

**My Modifications**
- Removing `tabindex="0"` from `computerBoard` images which will allow setting focus on them, otherwise the `listenForEnterKey` will trigger the click event on computer images too
- Using `transform: scale(1.1)` instead `width: 110%` on images hover/focus which will prevent the playerBoard height get increased and pushes `computerBoard` down a little
- Remove the hover/focus effect on computer images and make it specific to `.playerBoard .gameboard img`
- Setting `h2` height to the same `font-size` used for it, this will prevent winner message height getting increased a little bit (about 4 pixels) because of the Emoji
- Using `font-size: 3.9rem` instead of `5rem` for `.gameboard__square p` will fix shifting down the `cp_gameboard` when replacing computer images with `1 2 3`
